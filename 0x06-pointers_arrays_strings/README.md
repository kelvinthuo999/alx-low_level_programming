# NOTES

## Arrays

- An array is a data structure containing a number of data values of same type.
- Data structure is a format for organizing and storing data.
- sizeof() operator is used to determine the number of elements in an array.

## Pointers

- A pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable.

## Strings

- String literal is a sequence of characters enclosed within double quotes.
- %s is the placeholder used to print a string using printf function.
- String literals are stored as an array of characters.
- printf function always expects a string literal as argument.


# TASKS
[0-strcat.c](./0-strcat.c)
```
- The main task was to develop a function that is capable of concatenating two strings
  and append a null byte at the end.
- Simple pseudocode:
  - Take two INPUT
  - Create a variable to store the starting position of the destination string
  - Use a WHILE loop to move the destination pointer to the end of the string
  - Use another WHILE loop to copy source string to the end of the destination string
  - Append a NULL character at the end
  - Return the starting position of the concatenated string
```

[1-strncat.c](./1-strncat.c)
```
- The main task is to write a function that concatenates two strings
  and only uses n bytes from the source string.
- The logic is similar to the first task's code. The only difference
  only occurs when copying the source code to the destination code.
  You can only copy to the nth byte and the string has not reached
  the nth byte.
