## Introduction
This README file provides an overview of important concepts related to pointers, arrays, and strings in programming. It explains their definitions and key properties.

### Pointers
- A pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable.
- A pointer that is not assigned any value is known as a NULL pointer.
- The ampersand (&) symbol is used to access the memory address of a variable.
- The dereference operator (*) is used to access the value stored at the address held by a pointer.

### Arrays
- An array is a collection of similar data types stored at contiguous memory locations.
- Each element in the array is of the same type and occupies equal memory space.
- You can access any element of an array using its index.
- Array indexing starts from zero.
- Once an array is declared, its size and type cannot be changed.

### Strings
- Strings are one-dimensional arrays of characters terminated by a null character ('\0').
- A string literal is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.
- String literals cannot be assigned another set of characters.
- Adding "[^\n]" to the scanf function allows fetching space-separated strings.
- The string.h header file contains many functions for manipulating null-terminated strings.
