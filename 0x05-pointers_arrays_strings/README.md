#	NOTES 

##	Pointers
<pre>
-> A pointer is basically a variable that holds the address of another variable.
-> A pointer not assigned any value is known as a NULL pointer.
-> Ampersand is used to access the memory address of a variable.
-> Dereference operator is used to access the value stored in the address held by a pointer.
<pre>

#	Arrays 
<pre>
-> An array is a collection of similar data types stored at contiguous memory locations.
-> Each element in the array is of similar type and takes up equal memory space.
-> You can use index to access any element of an array.
-> Indexing starts with zero.
-> Once you declare an array, you cannot change the size and type.
<pre>

#	Strings
<pre>
-> Strings are one-dimensional arrays of characters terminated by a null character.
-> String literal is a sequence of characters enclosed by double quotes.
-> String literal cannot be assigned another set of characters.
-> An addition of [^\n] to scanf function enables to fetch space separated strings.
-> string.h header file contains many functions to manipulate null-terminated strings.

## Introduction
This README file provides an overview of important concepts related to pointers, arrays, and strings in programming. It explains their definitions and key properties.

### Pointers
- A pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable.
- A pointer that is not assigned any value is known as a NULL pointer.
- The ampersand (&) symbol is used to access the memory address of a variable.
- The dereference operator (*) is used to access the value stored at the address held by a pointer.

### Arrays
- An array is a collection of similar data types stored at contiguous memory locations.
- Each element in the array is of the same type and occupies equal memory space.
- You can access any element of an array using its index.
- Array indexing starts from zero.
- Once an array is declared, its size and type cannot be changed.

### Strings
- Strings are one-dimensional arrays of characters terminated by a null character ('\0').
- A string literal is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.
- String literals cannot be assigned another set of characters.
- Adding "[^\n]" to the scanf function allows fetching space-separated strings.
- The string.h header file contains many functions for manipulating null-terminated strings.
