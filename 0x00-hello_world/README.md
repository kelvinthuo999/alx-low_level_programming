## C programming basics

- This directory contains files on tasks that are done during into C programming language.

# TASKS

[0-preprocessor](./0-preprocessor)
```
- This task involves producing a command that only passes the source code through the preprocessor 
  during the compilation process.
- The task also involves naming the resulting file with a particular name.
```
[2-assembler](./2-assembler)
```
- This task involves only passing the source code through the assembler only during the compilation process.
```
[3-name](./3-name)
```
- This task involves producing an executable file from given source code and give it a particular name.
```
[4-puts.c](./4-puts.c)
```
- puts() is a function used to print out a string to the standard output.
- In this task, the function is put into use to printout the given string.
```

[5-printf.c](./5-printf.c)
```
- printf() is a function used to print out to the standard output.
- 5-printf.c contains a function used to place the function into use to print out 'with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,'.
```
[6-size.c](./6-size.c)
```
- sizeof() is an operator used to determine the amount of space a variable or a data type occupies in the memory.
- A function is developed to produced the amount of memory used for the different data types provided in the question.
```
[100-intel](./100-intel)
```
- A script is developed to generate Assembly code(Intel syntax) of a code and save it in an output file.
- The file is made executable by adding execution permissions to all users.
```
[101-quote.c](./101-quote.c)
```
- This tasks main aim is to develop a program to print out a quote.
- write() function is used to complete this task.
