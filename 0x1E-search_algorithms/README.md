# SEARCH ALGORITHM
- A search algorithm is a simple step-by-step procedure to locate a piece of information in a large collection of data.
- A search algorithm should be efficient and easiy scalable.
- In linear search, the algorithm will check each element against the target element step-by-step until it finds it or reaches the end of the list or array.
- Binary search is efficient in sorted data.
- Binary search works by dividing the sorted data by half until the data is found or not found in the list.

# TIME COMPLEXITY
- Time complexity is denoted by Big O notation.
- Time complexity is a measure of how the running time of an algorithm scales with the size of the input.
- O(1) is the most efficient time complexity.
