# NOTES
## Singly linked lists

- A singly linked lists is a data structure made up of nodes.
- A node contains two parts:
	1. Data: information to be stored in memory location.
	2. Pointer: pointing to the location of the next node.
- Traversing a singly linked list is visiting each node until the end node is reached.
- head of a singly linked list is a pointer pointing to the first node of the list.
- Loops are used to traverse the list.
- Singly linked lists can only be traversed in one direction(moving forward).
