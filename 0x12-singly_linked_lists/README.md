## Singly linked lists

- Data structures are a way of structuring data in order to efficiently store, find, use,
  create data, depending on the task at hand.
- Linked list is a data structure where data is stored in locations linked by pointers.
- Some resources to learn data structure:
	* https://www.careerdrill.com/blog/coding-interview/choosing-the-right-data-structure-to-solve-problems/
	* https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/
- Basic operations performed on data structures:
	1. Traversing
	2. Searching
	3. Insertion
	4. Deletion

- Navigation in a singly linked list is only in the forward direction.
