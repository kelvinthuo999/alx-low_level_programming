# NOTES 

- A dynamic library is a runtime-loaded code resource shared among multiple programs,
  optimizing memory usage and allowing seamless updates. 
- `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is an environment variable that specifies directories
  where the system's dynamic linker/loader looks for shared libraries when executing programs,
  enabling customization of library search paths.
